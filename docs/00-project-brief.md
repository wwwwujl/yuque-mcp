# Project Brief

## Problem

Research notes are stored in Yuque, but Codex cannot directly query Yuque as a knowledge source in this workspace.

## Outcome

Provide a local MCP server that exposes safe query and controlled write tools over Yuque API.

## Primary Users

- solo founder doing business and technical research
- Codex sessions that need fast context from internal docs

## Success Metrics

- Time to find a needed Yuque doc reduced
- Fewer manual copy/paste steps into prompts
- Stable tool calls with predictable outputs
